Water Conservation Game for Blue Planet.

It is written in Wiring the language of arduino.

Basically it is four sets of buttons consisting of two buttons per set.  The user selects one button in each group based on the description trying to conserve water.  After a button in each group has been selected the start button lights up prompting the user to push it.  Water drains from an upper tank through some pipes and into the resevoir.  The object is to have as little water drain as possible from the upper tank.

The reset button pumps water back to the upper tank and resets all the buttons back to their default values.
